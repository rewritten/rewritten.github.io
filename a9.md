about: |
  The *A9* platform is a system built for Spanish property agents, allowing
  them to automate almost all aspects of their work.

  It is also used by the *Direcci칩n General de Tr치fico*
  (the Spanish vehicle and traffic agency) to create
  electronic registration sheets for vehicles, and assign plaque numbers.

  It interconnects with banks to automate tax payments, and with all the
  integrated (local and national) treasury departments to communicate
  payments. Security is ensured by logging in only through a smart card with
  a personal X.509 certificate.

  It also control local label printers (at both the <abbr title="Direcci칩n General de Tr치fico">DGT</abbr>
  and the agents' offices) through a custom socket driver.

  The platform helped to reduce the times for vehicle registration from
  two months to one or two days, and is currently used in most Spanish
  territories. It has afterwards expanded to manage also real estate
  processes.
