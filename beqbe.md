about: |
  **beQbe** is a new social platform, based on a very simple principle in
  which users may generate and embed any content they want, and distribute
  it through the network in form of *Qubes*

  Other users may store those Qubes, comment on them and attach them into other
  Qubes.

  The platform enables also direct anonymous communication from the brands to
  the users, based on whether the users have stored the branded Qubes in their
  library, avoiding unsolicited communication and making it the best targetting
  platform available.

  Winner of the 2013 [EmprendedorXXI prize](http://premios2013.emprendedorxxi.es/) in Asturias
