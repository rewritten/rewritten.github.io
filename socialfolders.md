about: |
  Document synchronization tool for social networks and collaboration platforms.

  The user can connect several social network and other online systems, and
  select folders (depending on the service, they represent albums, categories...)
  to synchronize.

  Files put in these folders are automatically uploaded in the corresponding service,
  at the same time, files that appear on the remote service are automatically
  downloaded to the user's computer.

  One can copy files and entire folders between services, without waiting for
  the files to upload again, all the process is done in the cloud.

  The connected services include:

  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Flickr
  - Google Drive
  - SoundCloud
  - Evernote
  - SalesForce
  - Photobucket
  - Youtube
  - Box.net

tech:
  backend: "Rails and Sinatra"
  queue system: "beanstalkd"
  frontend: "QT - multiplatform"

role: Lead architect
what: |
  I have integrated most of the remote services, keeping up with the API changes
  and interpreting all the different metaphores of each system. I have also
  architected the queue system.
